                <p>In this first example, we are going to create a simple <b>chat workflow</b> to interact with an LLM (Large Language Model). We will use the <a href="/builder" target="_blank" title="Open graph Builder" class="font-bold">web-based graph builder</a> to define the workflow visually and export it as JSON for execution.</p>
            </section>

                <h2 class="text-2xl">Default Graph Layout</h2>
                <p class="pb-2">When you open the graph builder, you will see <b>three disconnected nodes</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Entry Node</b> - This is the starting point of the graph and will be executed first.</li>
                    <li><b>Exit Ok</b> - A terminal node indicating that the workflow has completed successfully.</li>
                    <li><b>Exit Err</b> - A terminal node indicating that the workflow has ended with an error.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-xl pt-2 pb-1">About Exit Nodes</h3>

                <p><b>Exit Ok</b> and <b>Exit Err</b> are <b>terminal nodes</b>: clicking on them does nothing because they have no configurable options.</p>
                <p class="pt-2 pb-1">They are only used to signal how the workflow finishes:</p>

                <p>- Use **Exit Ok** when execution completes successfully.</p>
                <p>- Use **Exit Err** when execution fails.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl">Editing the Entry Node</h2>
                
                <p>Clicking on the <b>Entry Node</b> will open a configuration form where you can set its options.</p>
                <p>For this first example, we will configure it to send the user's input to a language model and return its response.</p>
                <p>In the next steps, we will connect the nodes together to define the workflow logic.</p>
